# The Spades Software Collective and Consortium

Founded 2022

Hello, TSSCAC is a group of developers making software and websites and partnering with other communities to provide more content and help on their sites.

TSSCAC was made out of curiousity and has started to develop, we currently are partnered with a group known as LACRP, a Roleplay group to provide their website.
